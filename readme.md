# RDBMS Reading list

## Books

- The Art of PostgreSQL

- Art of SQL

- [SQL Performance Explained](https://sql-performance-explained.com/)

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)

- [PostgreSQL 14 Internals](https://postgrespro.com/community/books/internals)

- [PostgreSQL Query Optimization: The Ultimate Guide to Building Efficient Queries 2nd ed. Edition ](https://www.amazon.com/PostgreSQL-Query-Optimization-Ultimate-Efficient/dp/B0CK5GWWQ1)

## Websites and tutorials

- [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/): Nicely organized tutorial for beginner-level, PostgreSQL-flavored SQL. A single dataset is used to present the basics such as querying, joins, DML and aggregates. One shortcoming is that an old version of PostgreSQL is targeted (9.5; for example, it is assumed that columns cannot be in `group by` clauses).

- [Modern SQL](https://modern-sql.com/)

- [The Internals of PostgreSQL](http://www.interdb.jp/pg/index.html)

## Videos

- [Markus Winand - The Mother of all Query Languages: SQL in the 21st Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fb5Qgpr03g): This talk is on how SQL has changed through the standards published in 1999, 2003 and 2016. It is also a bit sobering as Winand mentions features present in latest SQL standard but did not yet get implemented in PostgreSQL, even after 7 years.
